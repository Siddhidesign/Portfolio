            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Jaihind, a growing clothing B2B retailer, was struggling with fragmented inventory processes. Their existing tools relied heavily on manual tracking and disjointed spreadsheets, leading to operational inefficiency and low tool adoption among staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>My Role:</strong> As the UI/UX Designer, I was tasked with consolidating 30+ complex merchandising and warehouse requirements into a single, intuitive dashboard that would streamline workflows for cross-functional teams.
            </p>

            <h3 class="phase-title">Phase 1: Uncovering the Friction</h3>
            <p>
                We couldn't simply "make it pretty." To solve the adoption issue, I needed to understand why the current process was failing. I conducted **35+ stakeholder interviews** across merchandising, warehouse, and sales teams, alongside rigorous workflow audits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The research revealed that users were overwhelmed by "data dumps" and unclear navigation, forcing them back to manual methods.

            <h3 class="phase-title">Phase 2: Translating Requirements into Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge was taking <strong>30+ complex requirements</strong>—from detailed SKU tracking to high-level sales reporting—and organizing them logically.
            </p>
            <p>
                I focused on creating clear information architecture (IA). The goal was "scannability." Warehouse managers needed to see critical stock alerts in seconds, not minutes.

            <h3 class="phase-title">Phase 3: Iterating on Data-Dense UI</h3>
            <p>
                B2B dashboards live or die by how they handle data density. I iterated closely with cross-functional teams (developers and product managers) to design components that were information-rich without being overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                We introduced "shortcuts" for common tasks like quick-add stock modals and bulk editing features directly within the data tables to improve operational efficiency and reduce reliance on manual tracking.
